## Governance alignment

WFSL Evidence Guard operates under the authority of the
WFSL Control and Execution Governance Charter.

The charter defines the non-negotiable principles governing execution authority,
evidence integrity, determinism, and control boundaries across WFSL systems.

This project implements evidence-generation and verification controls that are
justified by, and subordinate to, that charter.
